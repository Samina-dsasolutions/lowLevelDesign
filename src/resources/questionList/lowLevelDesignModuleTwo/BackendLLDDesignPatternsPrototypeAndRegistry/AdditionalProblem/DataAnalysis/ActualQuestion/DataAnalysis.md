# Q10. Data Analysis


## Facade pattern for Data Analysis Application
## Problem Statement
You are developing a software application for data analysis. The application involves data collection, preprocessing, analysis algorithms, and visualization. The interactions between these components can become complex. Your goal is to provide a simplified interface for data analysts to perform end-to-end analysis tasks without dealing with the inner workings of each component.

## Assignment
Your task is to implement the Facade pattern to refactor the existing data analysis workflow. The current workflow involves data collection, preprocessing, applying analysis algorithms, and visualization. Your goal is to implement a facade class that provides a unified and simplified interface for data analysts to perform these tasks seamlessly.

## Implementing the Facade Pattern
Review the original class: Take a closer look at the DataAnalysisManager class and its methods. Understand the dependencies it uses and the interactions with external services.

Complete the facade class: Complete the new class called DataAnalysisProcessor that implements the Facade pattern. This class will encapsulate the complex interactions with the external services and provide a simplified interface for clients.

Remember to call the constructor of your facade using the same arguments from the DataAnalysisManager class: The constructor of your DataAnalysisProcessor class should take the same arguments that the DataAnalysisManager class constructor does. This allows you to pass the necessary dependencies to the facade.

## Test your implementation: Test cases have been provided for you to test your implementation. Run the test cases to ensure that your facade class works correctly and provides the expected functionality.

## Instructions
Complete the new class named DataAnalysisProcessor.
Implement the Facade pattern within your DataAnalysisProcessor class to encapsulate interactions with external services.
Ensure that your DataAnalysisProcessor constructor takes the same arguments as the DataAnalysisManager constructor.
Run the provided test cases in the TestDataAnalysisManager class to verify the correctness of your implementation.
